### About Me
My name is Denis, at the moment I am working, but I dream of connecting my further career with web development. The Rolling Scopes School is an opportunity to show your skills and prove yourself. I love Javascript and everything connected with it, I want to constantly develop in this direction.


### Skills
  * HTML
  * CSS/SASS
  * JavaScript (Basic)
  * React (Basic)
  * Git/GitHub


### Code Example


Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case.


```
let countBits = function(n) {
  let str = n.toString(2);
  let count = 0;
  for (let key in str) {
    if (str[key] == 1) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```
